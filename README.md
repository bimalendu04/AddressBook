This is a small project done to learn implementation of Redux.
You can open [https://addressbooktest.netlify.app/](https://addressbooktest.netlify.app/) to view it live.

No database is connected yet but I will be connecting it with [MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com/) in future using [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [ExpressJs](https://expressjs.com/) and this will act as a [MERN](https://medium.com/@digimktg/what-is-mern-stack-9c867dbad302) stack application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
